# SiakadTIK-Data-Spy
<h1>Spying data from siakadtik( Unsika Computer Science Student's data ) using Node JS without logging in to website.</h1>

This is siakadtik website :

In case to see some data(Without my Siakad Data Spy application), you have to login through the website and you can just see your own data.


This is my application to Spy the data without login :
